# Resume_screening_and_ranking_system
The AI Candidate Resume Screening and Ranking System is an automated solution designed to assist HR professionals and recruiters in streamlining the candidate screening process. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, this system evaluates and ranks resumes based on their relevance to a specific job description, aiming to significantly reduce the time and effort required in the hiring process.

Key Features:

Resume Parsing:

The system extracts key information from candidate resumes, such as personal details, skills, education, professional experience, certifications, and other relevant qualifications. This process is critical in transforming unstructured data in resumes into structured information that can be analyzed.

Job Description Matching:

The system takes a job description as input and analyzes it to identify key requirements, such as skills, qualifications, and experience. It then matches the extracted information from the resumes to these job-specific criteria, determining how well each candidate aligns with the jobâ€™s demands.

Ranking Algorithm:

Candidates are ranked based on their suitability for the job position. The system employs an algorithm that assigns a score to each resume, with higher scores given to resumes that closely match the job description in terms of relevant skills, experience, and education.
Ranking can be done on various factors, including keyword match, skill proficiency, and overall experience relevancy.

AI Model Integration:

The system uses a combination of pre-trained machine learning models and custom-built algorithms that continually improve as more data is processed. This enables better accuracy and precision in resume screening, as the model can learn to recognize subtle patterns in candidate qualifications and job requirements.

Customizable and Scalable:

The system is highly customizable, allowing users to tweak the ranking algorithm based on their specific recruitment needs or job descriptions. It can also scale to handle large volumes of resumes, making it ideal for organizations of any size.

Benefits:
Efficiency: By automating the resume screening process, the system saves HR departments and recruiters significant time, allowing them to focus on other aspects of the hiring process.
Objectivity: The system reduces human bias in evaluating candidates, providing a more objective, data-driven approach to candidate selection.
Accuracy: By leveraging AI and NLP, the system ensures that only the most relevant candidates are considered, improving the overall quality of hires.
Cost-effective: Reduces the need for initial manual screening, helping businesses cut down on hiring costs.
Technologies Used:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis and extraction.
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for ranking and classification.
Python as the main programming language, utilizing libraries such as spaCy, nltk and scikit-learn for processing, modeling, and ranking.

This project is ideal for businesses seeking to modernize and automate their recruitment processes, ensuring a more efficient, unbiased, and accurate candidate selection.
